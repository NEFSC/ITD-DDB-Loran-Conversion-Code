# About LORAN-C

>The Loran system is a radio aid to navigation which utilizes  
the principle of hyperbolic fixing. The locus of points for which  
the difference in arrival time of synchronized signals from a pair  
of transmitters is constant determines a hyperbolic line of  
positions. The intersection of two hyperbolic lines of position  
from two pairs of stations determines a hyperbolic fix.

NOTE: LORAN-C has been deprecated: no LORAN towers now exist. However, many fishermen continue to refer to LORAN coordinates because it is a coordinate system they are accustomed to using to identify locations at sea.
